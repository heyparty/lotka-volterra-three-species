# Lotka–Volterra Three-Species Ecosystem Model

## Overview

This repository contains a **numerical and theoretical study of a three-species predator–prey ecosystem**, developed as part of a **Numerical Methods** course project.

The system models the interactions between:
- **Grass (H)** as a renewable resource,
- **Rabbits (L)** as herbivores,
- **Foxes (R)** as predators.

The objective of the project is to **model, simulate, and analyze** the dynamics of this ecosystem using a system of **nonlinear differential equations**, combined with **numerical methods and stability analysis**.

The project includes:
- a numerical solver implemented in **C** using RK4,
- data visualization scripts written in **Python**,
- theoretical analysis of **fixed points and stability**,
- a detailed written report (in French).

---

## Mathematical Model

The ecosystem is modeled using an extension of the classical **Lotka–Volterra equations** to three populations.

Each population evolves according to:
- growth or reproduction rates,
- consumption or predation terms,
- natural mortality rates.

The resulting system is **nonlinear** and exhibits a rich variety of behaviors depending on the chosen parameters:
- stable equilibria,
- oscillatory dynamics,
- limit cycles,
- partial or total extinction scenarios.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to:

- Model a three-level trophic ecosystem mathematically
- Solve nonlinear differential equations numerically
- Implement the **fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4)**
- Analyze equilibrium points (fixed points)
- Study local stability using the **Jacobian matrix**
- Visualize trajectories using **phase diagrams**
- Interpret numerical results from a biological perspective

## How to Run

### Requirements

To run this project, you need:
- GCC (or any C compiler)
- Python 3

- Python libraries:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

Install Python dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Numerical Simulation (C)

Compile and execute the RK4 solver:
```bash
gcc rk4_version_finale.c -o rk4
./rk4
```

This generates the file:
```bash
rk4_simulation.csv
```
which contains the numerical results.

### Plotting the Results (Python)

Run the visualization scripts:
```bash
python evolution_temporelle_version_finale.py
python diagramme_phase_version_finale.py
```
These scripts produce:
- population evolution over time,
- phase diagrams illustrating system dynamics.
